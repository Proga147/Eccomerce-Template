# Eccomerce-Template

This application was created by Shane.A.Proverbs. And is simply to demonstrate the CSS responsive development skills. Please do not copy or claim this template as your own.


- [x] #739

- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:


Also the template is still underdevelopement because the icons were made with SVGs you must view the webpage on a server to see the icons etc. Cross broswer support is not enabled for every browser e.g Safari.

Only Tested on Google Chrome, and Firefox.
